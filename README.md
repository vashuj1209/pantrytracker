# Pantry Management Application

A simple and elegant pantry management application built with Next.js, Material UI, and Firebase. The app allows users to manage their inventory, including adding, updating, and removing items, and provides a pie chart visualization of the inventory data.

## Features

- Add, update, and remove inventory items
- Search inventory items
- Visualize inventory data with a pie chart
- Responsive and modern UI

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications
- **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service for authentication and Firestore
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library for data visualization
- **React-Chartjs-2**: A React wrapper for Chart.js

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- A Firebase project set up with Firestore. You can create a project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pantry-management.git
cd pantry-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration

Create a `firebase.js` file in the `src` directory and add your Firebase configuration:

```js
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const firestore = getFirestore(app);

export { firestore };
```

### 4. Run the Application

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your application in action.

## Firebase Firestore Rules

For development purposes, ensure your Firestore rules allow read and write access:

```plaintext
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Remember to replace this with proper security rules for production.
